# Test content, per core

What each of the 100 built cores needs before it can be tested. Two kinds of line, kept apart
on purpose:

* **Requires** - taken from the core's own `.info`: its `supported_extensions` and any firmware it
  declares NOT optional. That is the core telling you what it needs, not me guessing.
* **Suggested** - my recommendation for a *test corpus*. Where a system has free homebrew or a
  freely redistributable shareware release, that is named, because a test set you can re-download
  and share beats one you cannot.

⚠ **A core that declares required firmware will not load content without it.** Those are listed
first; everything else can be tested with any dump you already own.

BIOS/firmware goes in `/data/retroarch/system/` (mode 666). Content anywhere readable -
`/data/retroarch/roms/` is what this port has been using.


## Firmware first — 17 cores will not run without these

## Firmware: solved, from a public pack

`Abdess/retrobios` (release `v2026.08.06`) carries every firmware file the hundred built cores
declare as REQUIRED - 34 distinct files, checked name by name against each core's own `.info`.

⚠ **The release assets are the wrong thing to download.** The RetroArch/Lakka pack is 2.6 GB
split across two parts, and almost none of it applies here. The repository keeps the same files
individually under `bios/`, so the 34 that matter came to **11.3 MB** fetched by name. There is
no reason to pull the packs.

They are on the console now, in `/data/retroarch/system/`, modes 666 and directories 777,
including the three that live in subdirectories (`keropi/`, `quasi88/`, `same_cdi/bios/`) - a
core looks for those by relative path and will not find them flattened.

Also present but not fetched: **129 optional** firmware files (70.5 MB) - alternate regions,
optional boot ROMs, expansion BIOSes. Fetch them if a specific core misbehaves; none is needed to
start.

⚠ **Eight optional files are absent from that repository** and would have to come from elsewhere
if ever wanted: `SGB1.sfc, SGB2.sfc, bios7.bin, bios9.bin, bios_E.sms, bios_U.sms, gb_bios.bin, gexpress.pce`. All eight are optional, so nothing in the table above is blocked.

## A starter corpus is on the console

From `/mnt/multimedia/Gry/`, into `/data/retroarch/roms/` (27 MB), chosen to cover the largest
core families with the fewest files:

    nes/     Legend of Zelda, Metroid            fceumm  mesen  nestopia  quicknes
    snes/    Zelda LTTP, Super Mario World       snes9x  snes9x2002/2005/2005_plus/2010
                                                 bsnes_cplusplus98  bsnes_mercury  mesen-s
    gba/     Metroid Zero Mission                gpsp  mednafen_gba  vba_next  vbam
    md/      Aladdin                             genesis_plus_gx  genesis_plus_gx_wide  clownmdemu
    arcade/  mslug.zip, 1941.zip                 fbalpha2012_neogeo  fbalpha2012_cps1  mame200x
    n64/     Shadows of the Empire (USA, Rev 2)  mupen64plus_next

That is **21 of the 100** testable right now without obtaining anything further.

### ⚠ Extracted or zipped is a decision, not tidiness

**The console ROMs are extracted.** Everything in that collection is `.zip`, and the archive path
is one this port has never run - `libretro-common`'s zip reader has not been exercised here once.
Testing a core through it would confuse "this core is broken" with "archives do not work yet",
and the first is what we are trying to learn.

**The arcade sets stay zipped, and must.** A MAME/FBA set IS the zip: many separate ROM chips
addressed by name inside one archive. Unpacking `mslug.zip` does not produce a loadable file, it
produces a directory the core cannot use. This is not the same kind of zip as the others.

**`snes/Super Mario World.zip` sits beside `Super Mario World.smc` on purpose.** Same game, both
forms, so the archive path can be tested against a known-good baseline - if the `.smc` plays and
the `.zip` does not, that is a finding about this port's zip reader and not about snes9x.

### Not taken, and why

The Megadrive collection is a 50-part RAR and `unrar` lists only the volume it is given, so
reaching past "A - F" means reading through the set. Aladdin came out of part 1 and is enough to
prove three cores; anything later is a longer extraction whenever it is actually wanted.

### ⚠ `.bin` is not a system, and matching on it produced a wrong test

The starter corpus was matched to cores by file extension, and `.bin` belongs to half the
industry. `smsplus` and `gearsystem` were listed under "Mega Drive" because both accept `.bin` -
they are **Sega 8-bit** cores (Master System, Game Gear, SG-1000) and share no hardware with the
Mega Drive at all. Fed `Aladdin (U) [!].bin` on the console, `smsplus` drew a black screen, which
is correct behaviour toward data it cannot read.

Of the three, only `clownmdemu` is a Mega Drive core.

Nothing in `/mnt/multimedia/Gry` carries Master System or Game Gear content, so those cores stay
untestable until an `.sms` or `.gg` file exists. A black screen from the wrong system is not a
result about the core and must not be recorded as one.

### ⚠ Seven cores need a BIOS they do not declare, and my check could not see it

The firmware audit above matched each core's `firmwareN_path` fields against the repository. That
was complete with respect to what the cores DECLARE - and the arcade cores declare nothing. All
seven say it in prose instead:

    fbalpha2012  fbalpha2012_cps1  fbalpha2012_cps3  fbalpha2012_neogeo
    mame2000     mame2003          mame2003_plus

    notes = "(!) The BIOS files must be inside the ROM directory."

So `fbalpha2012_neogeo` refused Metal Slug with `NeoGeo BIOS missing` and a list of files nothing
had told us to fetch. The repository had `neogeo.zip` all along - sixteen variants of it - and the
selection criterion was the thing at fault, not the source.

⚠ **AND THE BIOS DOES NOT GO IN `system/`.** It goes beside the games, in the ROM directory,
because an arcade BIOS is another ROM set rather than firmware. Now in
`/data/retroarch/roms/arcade/`: `neogeo.zip`, `qsound.zip` (CPS2), `pgm.zip`, `skns.zip`,
`decocass.zip` - 4.8 MB.

CPS1 needs no BIOS, so `1941.zip` failing with `Cannot find driver` is a different problem: the
set is from 2001 (`4143.bin`, `41_19.rom`, dated 1997-2001) and FBA 2012 wants far newer naming
and CRCs. ⚠ Not confirmed - "cannot find driver" is about the set NAME, so something else may be
going on - but the age of the contents is the first suspect.

### ⚠ "Optional" firmware is not optional, and that is the third time the .info under-declared

`a5200` refused to start with "missing bios". Its `.info` says:

    firmware0_path = "5200.rom"
    firmware0_opt  = "true"

The original selection fetched only files marked NOT optional, so it was skipped - and the core
does not run without it. The md5 in the same file's `notes` matched the copy in the repository
exactly (`281f20ea4320404ec820fb7ec0693b38`), so the source was right and the filter was wrong.

All 131 optional firmware files the repository carries are now on the console (70.5 MB). Together
with the arcade BIOS in the ROM directory and the required set fetched earlier, `system/` holds
everything `Abdess/retrobios` has for these hundred cores.

Three separate ways the `.info` files under-declare what a core needs, all found by running:

    arcade cores    say it in `notes` prose, with no firmware fields at all
    a5200           marks a mandatory BIOS `opt = "true"`
    nxengine        needs a whole game data directory, described only in `notes`

⚠ **The lesson is not "read notes too".** It is that a core's own metadata is a hint, and the only
reliable statement about what it needs is the core refusing to start and saying so.

### Dinothawr ships its own game, in its own repository

`notes` says it wants `Dinothawr.zip` and the file `dinothawr.game`. The data is not something to
find anywhere: the core's repository carries it, in `dinothawr/` beside the source - 6.6 MB of
levels, tiles and assets. The harness had already cloned it.

On the console at `/data/retroarch/roms/dinothawr/`; load `dinothawr.game`.

### The Onion Ports collection: one useful file, and a gap it does not fill

`OnionUI/Ports-Collection` is a set of standalone ports for the Miyoo Mini - native ARM binaries,
not libretro cores - so almost none of it applies here. Of 6839 files, exactly one matters:
`BIOS/prboom.wad`, PrBoom's own helper lump, which the core needs alongside a game.

⚠ **It ships PWADs and no IWAD.** `blood.wad`, `goldeneye.wad`, `counterstrike.wad` and the rest
are Doom *mods*: each needs a base game to load on top of, and the collection carries none. A
PWAD alone will not start PrBoom.

So the base came from **Freedoom 0.13.0**, which is free and drop-in - `freedoom1.wad` and
`freedoom2.wad`, 55 MB together, in `roms/doom/` beside `prboom.wad`. Load `freedoom1.wad`.

Nothing in the collection serves `tyrquake`, `ecwolf` or `reminiscence`: no `pak0.pak`, no
`ecwolf.pk3`, no Wolfenstein or Flashback data.

## ⚠ Two things this list cannot tell you

**A declared format is not a working format** - though `.zip` now is. That warning stood until
`xrick` played straight out of `data.zip` on 2026-08-25: the core declares `zip` as its only
extension and RetroArch read it, so libretro-common's archive reader works on this console. The
starter corpus is still extracted, and `snes/Super Mario World.zip` still sits beside the `.smc`
for the same reason - one proof is not the same as a tested path, and `.chd` and `.7z` remain
unexercised.

**Nothing here has been run.** Every core in this list built and linked and that is all that is
known about it - see `ps4/CORE-STATUS.md`, where every row still says `untested`.
